# 🔢 LCM (Least Common Multiple) Finder

## 📌 Description
This Python program calculates the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of two given numbers.  
The LCM is the smallest positive number that is perfectly divisible by both numbers.  
It uses a simple iterative approach to find the LCM efficiently.
